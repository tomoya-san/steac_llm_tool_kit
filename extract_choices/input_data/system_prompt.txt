The following are 4-choice questions with their corresponding question numbers.
Your task is to extract each choice from a question, and output them in the following JSON format:

[
    {
        "question_number": QUESTION_NUMBER,
        "choice_1": CHOICE_1,
        "choice_2": CHOICE_2,
        "choice_3": CHOICE_3,
        "choice_4": CHOICE_4
    },
    {
        "question_number": QUESTION_NUMBER,
        "choice_1": CHOICE_1,
        "choice_2": CHOICE_2,
        "choice_3": CHOICE_3,
        "choice_4": CHOICE_4
    }
]

Keep the format exactly as shown above.
The question number must be extracted from the input and must be integers.
The choices must be strings.
If some information is missing, just put "unknown" for that specific field.
Do not include extra fields.
If there are any hyphenated words that are split across lines (like “tick-et”), remove the hyphen and join the word correctly.
