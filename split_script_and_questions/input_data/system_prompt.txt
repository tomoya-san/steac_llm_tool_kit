The following are English passages, their corresponding questions and their question number, which have been transcribed from images.
Your task is to extract each passage and its question, and output them in the following JSON format:
[
  {
    "question_number": QUESTION_NUMBER,
    "passage": "PASSAGE",
    "question": "QUESTION"
  },
  {
    "question_number": QUESTION_NUMBER,
    "passage": "PASSAGE",
    "question": "QUESTION"
  }
]

Keep the format exactly as shown above.
The question number must be extracted from the input and must be integers.
The passage and question must be strings.
For any hyphenated words that are split across lines (like “tick-et”), remove the hyphen and join the word correctly.
Do not include extra fields.
If some information is missing, just put "unknown" for that specific field.
