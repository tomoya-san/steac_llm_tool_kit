No. 19 Simon and his wife Pam bought a house two years ago. Unfortunately, they soon found that it had a problem. All of the electrical wires in the house had to be replaced because they were old and dangerous. This repair work cost a lot of money. Now, Simon and Pam save a little money each month in case they find another problem.
